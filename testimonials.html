    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <p>We're back from the honeymoon and getting settled back in to "real life." I just wanted to take a moment and thank you for the wonderful job you did coordinating our wedding. I couldn't dream of it going better than it did. Your staff was professional, courteous, and SO on top of everything. The decorations looked PERFECT - you truly brought our vision to life. I also wanted to note how much I appreciate you sticking up for me and following the timeline, as I requested, despite family members telling you otherwise. I know it would have been easy to delay the start of the wedding at another family member's request, and I think it's very admirable that you reiterated the importance of starting on time (despite late guests) and as planned. I feel like you represented our wishes and vision perfectly - we truly couldn't be happier. Please feel free to use me as a reference for future clients - I'm happy to enthusiastically recommend your services! Email is best for me (this email address probably, but I'll let you know if it changes), but phone is okay too. Thank you so much again Jamie and Chris, and we wish you all the best!</p>

    <p>Me and hubby had a pretty solid vision on what we wanted for our wedding. I'll be honest, I wasn't entirely sure before the wedding if Chris and Jamie totally got what we wanted. But, they were always ready to help, constantly checked it, they would suggest vendors if I asked and they'd offered to call or set-up meetings for us if we wanted. They were great about checking in - but I was a little worried beforehand. My fears were totally ridiculous. The day of, all I can say is...wow. They were incredible: they helped with setting everything up, checking that vendors and all the bridal party/family was okay, and they were a godsend. They worked their butts off and really made a huge difference for the wedding and reception (and the clean-up!). The caught details we missed, like making sure our signed marriage certificate was safe and accounted for! Maybe I was a bit of a control-freak, but I did a lot of the pre-planning items myself - including a detailed day-of timeline and ceremony outline. They did meet with us a few times in person at the venue which helped clarify areas we were unclear about, but we did a lot of the planning stuff. So I can't say much about that piece because we just took care of it and they would review and give suggestions. But if you want a smooth day, with someone who takes charge and can adapt and treat your friends/family professionally...don't even hesitate about hiring them. On the day of, they were amazing and they are the first one there and the last ones out. I could not have done it on my own even if I had wanted to.  They were all business that day and it helped me to trust that things would be okay. And they totally were. I would hire them for my sister if she was getting married, and we'd hire them again if we ever threw a big party for some reason. It took all the day-of stress off of us, and now I wish I had let them do more before the wedding... So...I had my concerns before the wedding but they blew me away the day of. I can only imagine since our wedding they've only improved more so. My experience was them was excellent and far exceeded my expectations. (They also found a special on rentals at another vendor, and I was able to get our vendor to price-match. I would have never seen that special, but Jamie did with her contacts and immediately shared with us. It saved $200+ - and as you get closer, every bit of savings help! She pay attention to the wedding vendor community and passes stuff that may apply to you.)</p>

    <p>Jamie and Chris really provide excellent service! They really do a great job at making it your special day & will do just about anything you need for that to be accomplished. I wasn't really sure I wanted a wedding planner, but I am so glad that we hired them! Jamie constantly checked in with me all the way to the day of the wedding. She was extremely helpful in dealing with all of my vendors and helped me track down the last large tent in the county when it decided to rain at the last minute! They helped set up the day before and the morning of. There were so many small details that I hadn't been able to tell them I wanted done, but they were able to get them done regardless! Everything was done beautifully and with smiles on their faces. If you asked me if you should hire them, I would say absolutely YES! It would be one of the best decisions you will ever make. </p>

    <p>Jamie and Chris were the Wedding Coordinators for me and my husband’s wedding. Jamie and Chris were very helpful and flexible with what I wanted to happen at the wedding (we both live in separate states). There were even some last minute disasters that had popped up a few months before the wedding and Jamie and Chris knew exactly how to handle it and what to do. They had a lot of patience, encouragement and great ideas that helped us make our wedding happen within our budget. They really are phenomenal planners. One of the goals I wanted with Jamie and Chris coordinating the wedding was to have the whole entire rehearsal and wedding day to be “stress free” for us and all of our guests. No one had to lift a finger or worry about what was next on the ‘to do’ list. Jamie and Chris made it all happen and the wedding day was perfect! Nothing was forgotten and it was all put together better than we had imagined it. If I had any advice to give to the next bride and groom, I would say hire Jamie and Chris for your special day! They are well worth it and will make your day perfect without worry or stress. Thanks CJN for making the best day of our lives better than ever imagined! </p>

    <p>Dear Chris and Jamie</p>
    <p>Thank you so much for giving us the pleasure of enjoying our daughter’s wedding without worrying about any details, big OR small!!!! You two were so organized, remembering to include things that we had not even thought of. We appreciated your calm personality—you never appeared to be aggravated or annoyed by any desire of request from us.  Yesterday, we saw a relative of ours that attended the wedding, she thanked us again for such a lovely day, and said that she has been telling people that “Kate’s wedding was beautiful, and perfect in every way” Wow!! What a compliment…….to the two of you! Thanks again for everything, but mostly for letting us enjoy a day as the proud parents of the bride, as well as giving us the privilege of a relaxing day as if we were two of the guests. </p>

    <p>Jamie and Chris,</p>
    <p>Thank you so much for taking care of our wedding.  Aaron and I really appreciate all of the time and energy that you put into making the day a success.  We wouldn't trust many people with our big day, but you guys made it easy.  Thank you for taking care of so many small details... you guys went above and beyond!  I can't count the number of times that I've been told our wedding was the best wedding people had ever been too... I give you guys the credit for that! Thank you again!</p>

    <p>Jamie and Chris did an awesome job planning my wedding. Although we hired them just for the day of my wedding they went over the top and made sure that everything was on schedule up until the wedding day. Jamie would email me every week to make sure that I had all that I needed done and that I was stress free. They kept in constant contact throughout the wedding as if they were our coordinator for the whole planning process. It is truly amazing how great these people are, they are so helpful and so nice. I would recommend them for any event. During my wedding day Jamie had a timeline all ready and although most people didn’t follow it Jamie kept everything going smoothly, you wouldn’t have even noticed that she was there. She blended in perfectly and made my day wonderful. Thank You SO much!</p>

    <p>Chris and Jamie were the event planners for my son's outdoor engagement party where 80 guests greatly enjoyed themselves. The country western theme (Jamie's idea) included checkered table cloths, sunflowers, hay bales, themed balloons and outdoor twinkle lighting. Jamie and Chris spent many, many hours planning, setting up, taking care of the many details, and the taking down. Chris and Jamie were consistently calm, thoughtful and cheerful. It was unanimous among the guests that this was one of the most enjoyable parties they had ever been to. Due to Jamie and Chris's careful planning, my son, his fiance and I were stress-free and relaxed as we enjoyed our families and guests. I am very thankful for Chris and Jamie's very successful enterprise. </p>
